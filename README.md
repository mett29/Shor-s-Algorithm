# Introduction

This project was done as part of the *Software Engineering 2* course at Polytechnic of Milan. The aim was to explore the field of Quantum Computing to understand its characteristics and potential. In order to accomplish this task, I and other colleagues started from the paper [Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03719.pdf), from which each person chose an algorithm and then started its study. As you can understand, my algorithm is the Shor's algorithm.

# Shor's algorithm

Shor's algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) for integer factorization, formulated in 1994. Informally, it solves the following problem: Given an integer **N**, find its prime factors.

## Overview

*Lemma*: Factoring is equivalent to finding a nontrivial squareroot of 1 mod N.

## Structure of the algorithm

Shor's algorithm consists of two parts:

**1) [CLASSICAL PART]** A reduction, which can be done on a classical computer, of the factoring problem to the problem of order-finding.

**2) [QUANTUM PART]** A quantum algorithm to solve the order-finding problem.
